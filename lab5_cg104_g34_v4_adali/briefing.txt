Implement a multilayer perceptron for image classification. The neural network
should be trained with the mini-batch gradient descent method. Remember to
split the dataset into training and validation sets.
The main point of this task is to evaluate how various components and hy￾perparameters of a neural network and the training process affect the network’s
performance in terms of its ability to converge, the speed of convergence, and
final accuracy on the training and validation sets. For evaluation, please create
plots visualizing:
• The loss value for every learning step,
• Accuracy on the training and validation set after each epoch.
Make sure to include conclusions and observations based on the conducted
experiments in your report.
The details are described in your variant of the project.

Use the FashionMNIST dataset. Evaluate at least 3 different numbers/values/types
of:
• Learning rate,
• Mini-batch size (including a batch containing only 1 example),
• Number of hidden layers (including 0 hidden layers - a linear model),
• Width (number of neurons in hidden layers),
• Loss functions (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, Cross
Entropy).

2 Tips
• The network can be implemented with a library offering neural network
layers, optimizers, and error backpropagation. However, you must imple￾ment the learning procedure yourself – you cannot use libraries such as
fast.ai or lightning that train the model with model.fit(). I highly recom￾mend using PyTorch. This course may be useful for starting.
• Setting a fixed seed will make your results reproducible across different
runs. Check this article or others for details.
• To input an image (28 x 28 matrix for all the given datasets) into the
multilayer perceptron network, you need to flatten the image - represent
it as a vector.
• Training of neural networks can take a while, and you will train several of
them in this assessment. Keep this in mind and do not start working on
the lab at the last minute!
